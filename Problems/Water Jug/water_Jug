# Water jug problem
â€¢Statement: we are given three water jugs (A, B, C) with the capacities 8, 5, 3 liters respectively. All these jugs do not have any other measuring mark on it. Initially these jugs have water 6, 2, 0 liters, how can you get water in these three jugs 1, 4, 3 liter respectively?


## ðŸ§© Problem Setup

We have **three jugs**:

| Jug | Capacity | Initial Water | Goal Water |
| --- | -------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| A   | 8 liters | 6 liters      | 1 liter    |
| B   | 5 liters | 2 liters      | 4 liters   |
| C   | 3 liters | 0 liters      | 3 liters   |

So at the start:

```
A = 6, B = 2, C = 0
```

We want to end up with:

```
A = 1, B = 4, C = 3
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What Youâ€™re Allowed to Do

You can only:

1. **Pour water** from one jug into another.
2. **Stop pouring** when either:

   * The jug youâ€™re pouring *into* is **full**, or
   * The jug youâ€™re pouring *from* is **empty**.

You **cannot measure partially** â€” only fill/empty through pouring.

## ðŸ§  Step-by-Step Explanation

Letâ€™s figure out how to go from `(6, 2, 0)` â†’ `(1, 4, 3)`.

---

### ðŸª£ Step 1: Pour from B â†’ C

* B has 2 L, C has 0 L (and can hold 3 L).
* Pour all 2 liters from B into C.

Now:

```
A = 6, B = 0, C = 2
```

---

### ðŸª£ Step 2: Pour from A â†’ B

* A has 6 L, B can hold up to 5 L.
* Pour 5 liters from A into B (until B is full).

Now:

```
A = 1, B = 5, C = 2
```

---

### ðŸª£ Step 3: Pour from B â†’ C

* B has 5 L, C has 2 L (capacity 3 L, so only 1 more can fit).
* Pour 1 liter from B into C.

Now:

```
A = 1, B = 4, C = 3
```

âœ… Thatâ€™s our goal state!

## âœ… Final Answer

| Step    | Action     | (A, B, C) |
| ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Start   | â€”          | (6, 2, 0) |
| 1       | Pour B â†’ C | (6, 0, 2) |
| 2       | Pour A â†’ B | (1, 5, 2) |
| 3       | Pour B â†’ C | (1, 4, 3) |
| ðŸŽ¯ Goal | â€”          | (1, 4, 3) |

## ðŸ§© In Simple Words

Youâ€™re just **transferring water between jugs** until you reach the required distribution.
Think of it as balancing water between containers without spilling or guessing â€” just pouring fully or emptying.
